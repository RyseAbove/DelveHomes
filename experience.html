        <p>“My family and I love our DelveHome! We've been living here for 3 years now, and we have loved every second. Being a parent, our life can get pretty stressful at times. But our DelveHome makes 
        life easy and stress free for us. We can't recommend them enough!”

        <p>“Me and my wife have had a DelveHome for about 2 years, and we have to say, it was well worth it. If we want to learn how to cook something new, just ask the home! If we want to watch a scary 
        movie with the lights off, just ask the home! My wife and I highly recommend DelveHomes to everyone.”
