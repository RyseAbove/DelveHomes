            <h2>The Founder</h2>
        <p>This is the DelveHomes CEO, Lorem Ipsum. He takes great pride in ensuring that customers are satisfied with their homes and high quality airship travel. He founded DelveHomes in 1968 when he was only 27 years old. Since then, he has been running the company ever since.</p> 
    
            <h2>The Creation</h2>
        <p>In his earlier days, Mr. Ipsum spent his time as a mechanic in workshops selling machine parts. 
        However, one day, his discovery of airship technology shifted his interest and decided to pioneer it and 
        started his own business in airship technology.</p>
