            <h2>The Founder</h2>
            <p>This is our CEO, Lorem Ipsum. He is currently 81 years old. He founded
    DelveHomes when he was only 27 years old in 1968. He has been running the
    company ever since.</p> 
    
        <p>His first prototype airship was nicknamed, “The Flying Thing.”
    He built it in 1965, when he was 24 years old. Recognized from locals to international levels. 
    It has been stored in The Museum of Technical History since 1995.</p> 
    
        <p></p>In his earlier days, Lorem spent his time as a mechanic in workshops selling machine parts. 
    However, one day, his discovery of airship technology shifted his interest and decided to pioneer it and 
    start his own business in airship technology.
