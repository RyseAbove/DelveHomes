            <h2>The Founder</h2>
            <p>This is the DelveHomes CEO, Lorem Ipsum. He takes great pride in ensuring that customers are satisfied with their homes and high quality airship travel. In 1968, he founded
    DelveHomes when he was only 27 years old. Since then, he has been running the company ever since.</p> 
        <p>In his earlier days, Mr. Ipsum spent his time as a mechanic in workshops selling machine parts. 
    However, one day, his discovery of airship technology shifted his interest and decided to pioneer it and 
    start his own business in airship technology.</p>

    <p>Mr. Ipsum's crowning achievement in his career was his first prototype airship nicknamed, “The Flying Thing.”
        He built it in 1965, when he was 24 years old. It was highly recognized from locals to international levels. 
        It has been stored in The Museum of Technical History since 1995.</p>
